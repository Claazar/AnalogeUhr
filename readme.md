# Analog Clock Challenge

On **20.11.2024**, our coach in the basics year of my apprenticeship assigned us the task of coding an analog watch. The challenge was to create the clock using only **JavaScript** and **CSS**, without modifying the provided HTML.

For my take on this task, I drew inspiration from the **SBB Clock** design, aiming to replicate its behavior when the minute finishes.

### SBB Clock Inspiration

For those who are unfamiliar, the **SBB Clock** has a unique behavior when a minute finishes:
- The second hand pauses when the minute ends.
- It waits for confirmation from the atomic clock in Bern that the minute is over.
- Once the second hand starts moving again, the minute and hour hands "snap" into place with a slight **wiggle**.

Unfortunatally, I have not been able to recreate the Wiggle animation but will add it in the future.

### How to Use

To use this clock, simply download or clone this project and open the **HTML** file in your browser of choice. The clock will behave as described, with the second hand pausing at the top, waiting for the minute to finish, and then the hands snapping into place with a wiggle effect.

Enjoy and feel free to improve it or give me feedback!
