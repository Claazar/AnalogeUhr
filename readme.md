# Analog Clock Challenge

On **20.11.2024**, our coach in the basics year of my apprenticeship assigned us the task of coding an analog watch. The challenge was to create the clock using only **JavaScript** and **CSS**, without modifying the provided HTML.

For my take on this task, I drew inspiration from the **SBB Clock** design, aiming to replicate its behavior when the minute finishes.

### SBB Clock Inspiration

For those who are unfamiliar, the **SBB Clock** has a unique behavior when a minute finishes:
- The second hand pauses when the minute ends.
- It waits for confirmation from the atomic clock in Bern that the minute is over.
- Once the second hand starts moving again, the minute and hour hands "snap" into place with a slight **wiggle**.


### How to Use

To use this clock, you can either download and open the Project using the **HTML** file or you simply view the finished product via: [https://claazar.github.io/AnalogeUhr/](https://claazar.github.io/AnalogeUhr/).

Enjoy and feel free to improve it or give me feedback!
